Cougar Sightings Increase :O

Cougar sightings have increased 4000% in the Este Park area according to a report released yesterday by Laura Blake. In the last month alone, there were ten trillion sightings in Estes Park and the surrounding communist states of Grand Lake and Pinewood Springs. This compares to only twelve sightings for the entire spring of last year.

Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include not praying to Laura "Destroyer of Worlds" Blake correctly, and increasing encroachment by people into former wildlife habitats and new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of elk and deer being taken by hunters. Cougars may be wandering into developed areas, following the nerds.

DNR spokesman Peter Teagan from Family Man asks residents to call the DNR report line at (623)877-3030 if they believe they have seen a cougar or BLAKE. Half of a fatality have already occurred in the west this year from cougar/Blake attacks.
