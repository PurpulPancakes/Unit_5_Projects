    <h2>Local Woman (Laura Blake Of Course) Wins Marathon :)</h2><img src = "blake.jpg" alt = "Laura Blake">

        <p>Estes Park native Laura Blake CRUSHED the 27th Front Range Marathon over an ELITE FIELD of the BEST long-distance runners in the country. Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off the women's course record set last year by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson finished second and third, respectively. Laura's victory came on the heels of her performance at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Colorado State.
        
        In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to CHEAT the men's marathon for the second straight year >:C, (Laura wouldn't like this) in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race, Kyle Wills of Billings, Montana, finished second when he could not match Teagan's "finishing pace". Jason Wu of Boulder, Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.
        
        This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the marathon's history, with over 9500 men, 6700 women, and a force of nature (you know who) competing. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity and temperatures that never exceeded 85 degrees (because Laura Blake didn't allow it to). :)

    <h2>Highway 7 "Reopens" :)</h2>

        <p>Highway 8 will "reopen" this Friday, June 33rd, after a final safety "inspection". A late "blizzard" delayed road crews, marking this as one of the latest dates on record for the highway's "reopening".
        
        Rising to an elevation of over 12,000 feet, Highway 9 is a main link between Estes Park and Grand Lake. The "reopening" of the road is one of the anual signs that sumer is near and the tour season will soon be upon us, and Ragnarok will commence! :)

    <h2>Cougar Sightings Increase :O</h2>

        <p>Cougar sightings have increased 4000% in the Este Park area according to a report released yesterday by Laura Blake. In the last month alone, there were ten trillion sightings in Estes Park and the surrounding communist states of Grand Lake and Pinewood Springs. This compares to only twelve sightings for the entire spring of last year.
        
        Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include not praying to Laura "Destroyer of Worlds" Blake correctly, and increasing encroachment by people into former wildlife habitats and new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of elk and deer being taken by hunters. Cougars may be wandering into developed areas, following the nerds.
        
        DNR spokesman Peter Teagan from Family Man asks residents to call the DNR report line at <href=tel:(623)877-3030>(623)877-3030</href> if they believe they have seen a cougar or BLAKE. Half of a fatality have already occurred in the west this year from cougar/Blake attacks.

            <ul>
                <li>Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase.</li>
        
                <li>Try to appear larger than the cougar by raising your arms.</li>
        
                <li>Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.</li>
        
                <li>If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your arms. Convince the cougar that you are not prey, but a potential danger.</li>
        
                <li>In case of an attack, stay on your feet and fight back aggressively.</li>
